In this small exploration I wanted to see what were the lowest temperatures in Cornwall, Ontario when I lived there from 2011 to 2016 and practice with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The data was downloaded from https://cornwall.weatherstats.ca/download.html, which state: "The historical weather data, forecast and current conditions graphics are courtesy of Environment and Climate Change Canada (http://weather.gc.ca/). The information presented is combined from multiple Environment and Climate Change Canada data sources and all effort is made to be accurate."
